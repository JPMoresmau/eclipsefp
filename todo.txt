- achievements!

- pref for autocompletion characters (default: none)

- rebuild file when closed without saving

- autocomplete perf

- format using haskell-src-exts

- clean up preferences
	- no option for GHC/GHCi: we need to know what options to ignore for GHCi, since these options are going to appear in the Cabal file
	- GHC options on each project as well

- GHC 6.12 -dynamic option (http://mostlycode.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/ghc-6-12-1-dynamic-executables-fun/)

- code manipulation: should be pluggable into scion without recompiling???
	- broken refactorings (point free, etc...)

- files not haskell in source folders could go into data-files automatically

- project actions
	- clean
 -> via scion or via cabal impl directly


- occurences + search for Haskell objects in project/workspace


- run Ghci with proper flags done partially
	- ask which cabal component to take
	- what about conditional in cabal (like scion: if ghc impl...)
	- remove inproper options
	- ignore .ghci file option? (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghci-dot-files.html -ignore-dot-ghci)

.ghci file parsing/editor?? (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghci-dot-files.html http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2010/01/using-ghci-files-to-run-projects.html http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2010/01/better-ghci-files.html)

- integrate analysis tools like SourceGraph, HLINT, hpc, HaskaBelle
- integrate doc tools hoogle,haddock
- integrate runtime tools like criterion
- integrate HaRe for refactoring?

- debugging 
	- column on breakpoint??
	- try to use :hist to display full stack (can we intercept write to add :trace in front?)
	- better system to force evaluation? Done with custom value setter calling :force what about calling seq ... ()?
	- reloading modules when stopped seems to cause breakpoints to disappear in GHCi, to check

- add Haskell nature + related file to existing project

- import management (order import, only import what's needed, add proper import for function?)

- project rename
- module rename (rename file + module name + imports + in cabal)

- CAPRI http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Capri to install scion
	- built-in -> install global/local/project
