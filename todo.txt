disallow new projects with spaces in names

run cabal update before new scion install (when unzipping) but not on forcibly rebuilding

why clicking on run arrow asks me between ghci and hugs? can't reproduce

- several background-typecheck-arbitrary queued when we're building: only keep the last one for each file

- clean up preferences
	- no option for GHC/GHCi: we need to know what options to ignore for GHCi, since these options are going to appear in the Cabal file
	- GHC options on each project as well

- GHC 6.12 -dynamic option (http://mostlycode.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/ghc-6-12-1-dynamic-executables-fun/)

- code manipulation: should be pluggable into scion without recompiling???
	- broken refactorings (point free, etc...)
	- add type signature  done as quick fix on warning

- files not haskell in source folders could go into data-files automatically

- project actions
	- clean
	- sdist (in progress)
 -> via scion or via cabal impl directly


- occurences + search for Haskell objects in project/workspace


- run Ghci with proper flags done partially
	- ask which cabal component to take
	- what about conditional in cabal (like scion: if ghc impl...)
	- remove inproper options
	- ignore .ghci file option? (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghci-dot-files.html -ignore-dot-ghci)

.ghci file parsing/editor?? (http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/ghci-dot-files.html http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2010/01/using-ghci-files-to-run-projects.html http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2010/01/better-ghci-files.html)

- integrate HUnit/Quickcheck?
- integrate analysis tools like SourceGraph, HLINT, hpc, HaskaBelle
- integrate doc tools hoogle,haddock
- integrate runtime tools like criterion
- integrate HaRe for refactoring?

- cabal install interface (list modules, show new version of installed modules, choose which modules to install/update, etc...)

- debugging 
	- column on breakpoint??
	- try to use :hist to display full stack (can we intercept write to add :trace in front?)
	- better system to force evaluation? Done with custom value setter calling :force what about calling seq ... ()?
	- reloading modules when stopped seems to cause breakpoints to disappear in GHCi, to check

- add Haskell nature + related file to existing project

- import management (order import, only import what's needed, add proper import for function?)

- project rename
- module rename (rename file + module name + imports + in cabal)

- CAPRI http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Capri to install scion
	- built-in -> install global/local/project
