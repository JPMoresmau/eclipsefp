- dependencies from bw should have sandbox package
	- showing in libraries in package explorer

- package list in dependencies (cabal editor) -> include all projects if we have sandbox
	- choosing a package matching a project name should add the project reference

- imports auto completion need exposed modules from reference projects
	- and all symbols in these modules
	- use usage database? or component list (exposed modules are in it)
