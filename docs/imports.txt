organize imports
	- on current source
	- on file(s)/folders

- get module from file
- get all references in module from usage tables
- get current imports lines and qualifiers from outline or usage tables too!
- do not touch preprocessor directives

- check Prelude is explicitely imported or not
- if there is import Module(), leave it (for instances) -> make it a preference?
- order: 
	- modules from same component
	- modules from dependent components
	- modules for dependent projects
	- other libraries
	- base
  and alphabetical in each section? -> see GHC guidelines


- module imported, no details
	-> only import what's used
	-> nothing -> remove
- module imported, details
	-> remove what's not used
	-> nothing left -> remove
