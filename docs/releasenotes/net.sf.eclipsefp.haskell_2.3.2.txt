EclipseFP Haskell 2.3.2

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.6.2 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.10 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- accept tab between section type and name in Cabal files
	- treat filenames as default encoding, not utf8
	- only accept ascii characters in project names, since accented characters do not work well with gcc and such
	- adding a list to cabal (example: data-files) via the ui does not mess the cabal file
	- synchronize operations do not block other operations
	- Terminating a debugging session when stopped at a breakpoint removes correctly breakpoint marker in code
	- Terminating a debugging session correctly forbids to resume execution (restart a new session)

Features:
	- Specify the cabal stanza you want to use settings from when checking a file in the editor
	- In preferences for executables, you can install the executable from Haskage
	- Install all helper executables from one dialog
	- Install all dependencies for one project from right click on project (performs a clean of the project afterwards). 
	- BuildWrapper and scion-browser should build with GHC 7.6
	- If you run a GHCi session in debug mode and launch a function with :trace, :hist output will show as a stack trace in the Debug perspective
	- Watch action on editor adds the selected text as a debug expression
	- Display action on editor evaluates the expression in current GHCi session (only visible if stopped at a breakpoint in debug GHCi session)
	- Scion-browser path is optional in preferences

Internal:
	- Hopefully performance of some UI operations has been enhanced and the UI should be more responsive in places

Upgrade notes:
	- Upgrade via the Eclipse install site http://eclipsefp.sf.net/updates.
