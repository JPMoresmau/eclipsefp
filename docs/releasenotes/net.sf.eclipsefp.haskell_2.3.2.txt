EclipseFP Haskell 2.3.2

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.6.2 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.10 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- accept tab between section type and name in Cabal files
	- treat filenames as default encoding, not utf8
	- only accept ascii characters in project names, since accented characters do not work well with gcc and such

Features:
	- Specify the cabal stanza you want to use settings from when checking a file in the editor
