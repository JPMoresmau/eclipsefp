EclipseFP Haskell 1.109

Release Notes

Scion:
  You need Scion, the Haskell IDE library. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.
  You cannot use the version from Hackage (0.1.0.2) since commands have been added for eclipsefp. You'll need to build Cabal from source 
  (git clone git://github.com/jpmoresmau/scion.git, runhaskell Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Fixes:
- issue with scion directory (error saying that the project is not in a relative directory)
- various issues with Cabal file handling
- handle empty source paths
- some fixes linked to Scion operation ordering, resource tree locks, etc.

Features:
- quick fixes on a few GHC warnings (add type signature, add some language pragmas, remove unused import). To be extended
- choose initial components on project creation (executable and/or library)
- improve go to declaration behaviour (jump even to things that are not exposed)
- GHC preferences
	- ui has been reorganized using collapsable composites instead of tabs
	- preferences are now used to prepopulate ghc-options and extensions fields of the Cabal file of a new project
	- for GHC>6.8.1, new syntax -XOption is used instead of -fOption
