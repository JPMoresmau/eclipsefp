EclipseFP Haskell 2.5.5

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.7.6 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.19 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- Spaces in Hugs executable path accepted in preference page 
	- Show UUAGC errors correctly (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/125)
	- Do not try to parse HLint output if empty
	- Bug in styles range handling (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/129)
	- Code defensively to avoid https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/130
	- Cabal packages views sorts properly versions
	- Disable component choice on new project if one cabal file exists, even if it has another name than the project name (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/114)
	- Scion-browser wouldn't start on Eclipse Juno/Kepler if "start only when Haskell perspective is activated" preference is checked and Haskell perspective opened on startup
	- Enable spell checker on Haskell comments and string literals, and on the whole Cabal file (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/141)
	- Better comment handling (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/141)	
	- Show proper error messages when names contain HTML reserved characters
