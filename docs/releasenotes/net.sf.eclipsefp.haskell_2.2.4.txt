EclipseFP Haskell 2.2.4

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.5.1 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.8 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- Supports hlint Notes in hlint output parser
	- Support hlint not managing to parse sources (example with Template Haskell)
	- Do not run HLint on sources inside .dist-buildwrapper
	- 2.2.3 regression fixed: running GHCi with hidden packages failed (wrong quoting)	
	- Show constructors from same project in auto completion
	- Removing Cabal implementations when executable is not found
	- Quick fix for import of constructor gives choice between importing Type(Constructor) or Type(..)

Features:
	- Task tags: special words in comment create tasks (TODO, FIXME, XXX by default)
	- Search for breakpoints and breakpoints source in referenced projects, not only current projects
	- Haddock generation now uses cabal haddock instead of calling haddock directly
		- wizard is simpler
	- GTK new project wizard: creates an executable with a dependency on GTK and showing a simple Hello World Button application
	- New projects use current user name as default author name
	- Extra cabal parameters in project properties
		- pass to Cabal configure
		- special UI for extra lib dirs and extra include dirs
	- Content assist can search for symbols that are:
		- already imported (as before)
		- in all the packages referenced by the project. The module import will be automatically added.
		- in all the packages in the local package databases. The module import and the package reference in build-depends will be automatically added
		- A preference allows the user to specify which scope to use. Default is to search in all packages.

Internal:
	- On files bigger than 20k, do syntax coloring in a job. There is a preference to change the threshold.
