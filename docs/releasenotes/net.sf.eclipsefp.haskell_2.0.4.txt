EclipseFP Haskell 2.0.4

Release Notes


Scion:

  EclipseFP relies on Scion, the Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its
functionality. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.

  You cannot use the version from Hackage  since commands have been
added for eclipsefp. From version 1.111, eclipsefp includes a modified source
distribution of scion, that is built and used by eclipsefp if the use built-in
server preferences option is checked. Since it is by default, eclipse might be
a bit slow to start the first time scion is built. Otherwise, you can build
Scion from source (git clone git://github.com/JPMoresmau/scion.git, runhaskell
Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Fixes:
  - do not auto detected files starting with cabal that do not report a version number

Features:
  - Support GHC 7.0
  - Cabal test-suite syntax supported in syntax editor: http://www.haskell.org/cabal/release/cabal-1.10.1.0/doc/users-guide/#test-suites
     - Cabal test option on contextual project menu. This is only a short term solution, expect a new version of EclipseFP with full launch configuration support for cabal test.

Internal:

Upgrade notes:
  - If you had EclipseFP configured with a previous version of GHC and Cabal, run autodetect again in the Haskell Implementations and Scion and Cabal preference pages.
