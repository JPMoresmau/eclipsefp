EclipseFP Haskell 2.4.3

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.6.5 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.13 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- Viewing a package in the browser from the Cabal Packages view the first time could cause a NullPointerException
	- Removing via quick fix an unused type in import list did not remove constructors
	- Report errors from alex and happy building
	- Syntax highlighting more stable on big files
	- Haskell test results does not reclaim focus on each refresh, less flicker on update
	- Quick fix on multiple GHC suggestions

Features:
	- Cabal Packages view shows a green tick on installed packages and versions when you display the list of all hackage packages.
	- Distinguish comments/haddock/pragmas in syntax highlighting (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/44)
	- Use project root as HLint working folder
	- Organize imports on single file: only keep actually used imports
	- Refactor->rename can rename local bindings
