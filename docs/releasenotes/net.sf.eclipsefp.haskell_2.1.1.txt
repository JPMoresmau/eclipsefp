EclipseFP Haskell 2.1.0

Release Notes


Scion:

  EclipseFP relies on Scion, the Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its
functionality. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.

  You cannot use the version from Hackage  since commands have been
added for eclipsefp. From version 1.111, eclipsefp includes a modified source
distribution of scion, that is built and used by eclipsefp if the use built-in
server preferences option is checked. Since it is by default, eclipse might be
a bit slow to start the first time scion is built. Otherwise, you can build
Scion from source (git clone git://github.com/JPMoresmau/scion.git, runhaskell
Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Fixes:
	- The profiler plugin references properly all needed plugins to compile under all versions of Eclipse
	- Fix issues with special editors (Happy, Alex and web based editors)

Features:
	- JDT and WST can be automatically installed when installing EClipseFP
	- It is now allowed to have a project name that is not the same as the name of the cabal file. EclipseFP uses the cabal file found under the project. An error is logged if several cabal files exist.

Internal:
	- uses BuildWrapper instead of Scion, which allows building of projects that have Cabal>1.8 references between components, C sources, etc
