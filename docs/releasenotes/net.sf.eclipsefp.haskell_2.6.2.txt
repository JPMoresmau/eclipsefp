EclipseFP Haskell 2.6.1

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.8.7 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.3.2 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- Fix auto indent on cabal file edition
	- Do not create .HTF history folder in project folder
	- Fix --with-ghc flag not passed properly to some operations (install dependencies, etc). Note that due to a Cabal limitation (https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1511) GHC needs to be in your path for successful sandbox init.
	- Fix wrong arguments passed to GHCi session causing warning messages
	- Do not install dependencies of a projet that has a dependent project in the same sandbox, install dependencies of top level projects (otherwise Cabal complains).

Features:
	- Environment tab on Haskell run configurations, passed to process
	- Choose common sandbox location
	- Preference to disable automatic project dependency management (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/235)
