EclipseFP Haskell 2.0.2

Release Notes


Scion:
  You need Scion, the Haskell IDE library. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.
  You cannot use the version from Hackage (0.1.0.2) since commands have been added for eclipsefp. From version 1.111, eclipsefp includes a modified source distribution of scion, that is built and used by eclipsefp if the use built-in server preferences option is checked. Since it is by default, eclipse might be a bit slow to start the first time scion is built. Otherwise, you can build Scion from source (git clone git://github.com/JPMoresmau/scion.git, runhaskell Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Fixes:
  - Thing at point command correctly sets the proper file context and parses the result correctly

Features:
  - Specify Cabal implementation to use to build internal Scion
  - Open Definition has been enhanced:
	- correctly finds proper definition when several names existed in the project in different modules
	- opens definition in source files in referenced projects
	- opens external source or haddock documentation (driven by preferences, by default, searches in the local Haskell implementation and on Hackage)
  - Interface to cabal sdist via Project -> Export -> Haskell -> Cabal Source export

Internal:
  - Refactor of scion client plugin for better stability, better performance and cleaner code

Upgrade notes:
  - When upgrading through the Eclipse mecanism, scion will not be rebuilt when you restart. You need to go to Preferences -> Haskell -> Scion and Cabal and select one Cabal install (using Autodetect usually works fine). Upon clicking OK scion will build.
