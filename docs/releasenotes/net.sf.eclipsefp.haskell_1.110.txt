EclipseFP Haskell 1.110

Release Notes

Scion:
  You need Scion, the Haskell IDE library. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.
  You cannot use the version from Hackage (0.1.0.2) since commands have been added for eclipsefp. You'll need to build Cabal from source 
  (git clone git://github.com/JPMoresmau/scion.git, runhaskell Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Fixes:
  - issues when Cabal files didn't end with new line
  - changes launch command line when cabal file changes
  - sourceforge 2919994: cannot change color of characters fixed

Features:
  - launch GHCi sessions in debug mode
	- toggle line breakpoints in Haskell source
	- stop automatically at breakpoints, then single step
	- see variables at stop point and possibility to force their evaluation
	- GHCi preferences: use Show on print, stop at exception/errors
	- evaluate arbitrary expressions when stopped
  - see outline components in project view
