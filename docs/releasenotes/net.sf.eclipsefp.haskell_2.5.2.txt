EclipseFP Haskell 2.5.2

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.7.1 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.13 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- Cabal editor allows a dependency from an executable or a test class to a library via the add dependency UI
	- Stack Overflow when using a project with a dependency from an executable to a library with cabal-dev fixed (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/92)
	- Key bindings for actions are specific to Haskell/Cabal editors and do not pollute other editors (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/93)

Features:
	- Rebuild executables if workspace is autobuilding when dependent project is rebuilt (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/94)
