EclipseFP Haskell 2.0.5

Release Notes


Scion:

  EclipseFP relies on Scion, the Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its
functionality. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.

  You cannot use the version from Hackage  since commands have been
added for eclipsefp. From version 1.111, eclipsefp includes a modified source
distribution of scion, that is built and used by eclipsefp if the use built-in
server preferences option is checked. Since it is by default, eclipse might be
a bit slow to start the first time scion is built. Otherwise, you can build
Scion from source (git clone git://github.com/JPMoresmau/scion.git, runhaskell
Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Fixes:
- Cabal preferences mismatch error is now a warning, and preferences synchronize automatically with current versions
- bug-reports cabal field now properly highlighted
- only accept valid project names in project creation wizard
- clean cabal automatically when GHC complains of a missing -package-id
- Latex literate style supported by syntax highlighter
- {-# #-} pragmas now marked properly as comments in syntax highlighter
- files containing tabs instead of space: a warning is raised when opening to give the option of converting tabs to space, 
  since in most cases with GHC7 the editor will crash on opening. Option to disable "spaces for tabs" in preferences removed. You can't have tabs, full stop.
- on unix, an error "getFileStatus: does not exist" could happen

Features:
- Quick Fix: add missing dependency on hidden package
- run cabal update before building scion
- Wizard on projects (cabal source export, install, test, haddock export) will ask the user to save files if there are unsaved files in the project

Internal:

Upgrade notes:
  - If you had EclipseFP configured with a previous version of GHC and Cabal, run autodetect again in the Haskell Implementations and Scion and Cabal preference pages.
