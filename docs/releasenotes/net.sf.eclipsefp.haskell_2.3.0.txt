EclipseFP Haskell 2.3.0

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.6.0 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.8 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- rebuild project correctly if a Happy, Alex or UUAGC file is modified
	- Accept space only as separator for extensions field in cabal file
	- Autocompletion shows symbols from other modules in same project, but not imported (adds import automatically)

Features:
	- Output (exe) generation on build can be disabled by adding output=true to the haskell builder command of the .project file
	- Search for Haskell types/functions/constructors/modules (definitions + usage)
	- Quick Fix for more missing pragmas
