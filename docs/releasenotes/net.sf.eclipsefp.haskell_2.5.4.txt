EclipseFP Haskell 2.5.4

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.7.2 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.17 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- Close all long running processes properly when project is deleted

	- allow installing dependencies on sandbox projects if dependencies are not found
	- cabal install action can install into arbitrary sandbox if cabal-dev is used
