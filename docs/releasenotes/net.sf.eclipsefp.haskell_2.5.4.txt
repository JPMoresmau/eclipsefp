EclipseFP Haskell 2.5.4

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.7.4 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.17 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- Close all long running processes properly when project is deleted
	- Disable component group on new project creation if cabal file already exists (since existing file will be reused)
	- Haskell UI Plugin would randomly fail on startup, causing all kind of grief. A bug in the initialization of the plugin has been found and fixed.
	- Closing Eclipse polluted the log with spurious "stream is closed" messages from the console
	- Errors suggesting language flag could sometimes be badly parsed
	- Better handling of some GHC errors

Features:
	- pass -j to cabal install (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/107)
	- allow installing dependencies on sandbox projects if dependencies are not found
	- cabal install action can install into arbitrary sandbox if cabal-dev is used
	- add Haskell and Yesod natures to other projects (https://github.com/JPMoresmau/eclipsefp/issues/102)
	- Ctrl-click opens definition of the underlying symbol, and can follow URLs too.
