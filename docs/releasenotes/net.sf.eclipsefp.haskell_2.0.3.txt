EclipseFP Haskell 2.0.3

Release Notes


Scion:
  You need Scion, the Haskell IDE library. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.
  You cannot use the version from Hackage (0.1.0.2) since commands have been added for eclipsefp. From version 1.111, eclipsefp includes a modified source distribution of scion, that is built and used by eclipsefp if the use built-in server preferences option is checked. Since it is by default, eclipse might be a bit slow to start the first time scion is built. Otherwise, you can build Scion from source (git clone git://github.com/JPMoresmau/scion.git, runhaskell Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Fixes:
  - Scion dependency on AttoJSON fixed to require 0.5.8
  - Where dependent packages are shown (project explorer, project properties) the project is correctly loaded if need be
  - when launching GHCi, only hidden packages are added via -package

Features:
  - Interface to cabal install via contextual action on project
  - Cabal sdist now writes its output to a console
  - Code templates (import, gadt, data, case, do, let, newtype, class, single and multi line comments and haddock instructions

Internal:
