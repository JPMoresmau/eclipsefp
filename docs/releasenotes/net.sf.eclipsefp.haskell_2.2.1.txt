EclipseFP Haskell 2.2.1

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.3.0 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.1 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- there is now an icon in the Outline of the Cabal editor for source-repository entries
	- a project that used its root as a source folder showed itself recursively in project explorer
	- haskell and cabal editors show readonly/writable, overwrite/insert, line and column information like other text editors
		(http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipsefp/forums/forum/371922/topic/4889457)
	- you can now open a Haskell file in GHCi even if it doesn't belong to a project source folder
		(http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipsefp/forums/forum/371922/topic/4928771)
	- do not show cabal file in project explorer if it doesn't exist
		(http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipsefp/forums/forum/371922/topic/4928771)
	- running a file in GHCi uses the library source folders if the component the file belongs to references its own library

Features:
	- autodetect buildwrapper and scion-browser if they're in the PATH
	- preference to turn on/off the logging of buildwrapper JSON response in console (default: off)
	- comment/uncomment lines on cabal sources
	- run executables and test suites from project explorer cabal stanzas
	- open declaration should work from type annotations and import statements
