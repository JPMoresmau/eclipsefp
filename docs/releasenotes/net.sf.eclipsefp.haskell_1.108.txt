EclipseFP Haskell 1.108

Release Notes

Scion:
  You need Scion, the Haskell IDE library. See http://code.google.com/p/scion-lib/ for more information.
  You cannot use the version from Hackage (0.1.0.2) since commands have been added for eclipsefp. You'll need to build Cabal from source 
  (git clone git://github.com/nominolo/scion.git, runhaskell Setup.hs configure/build/install)

Features:
- use Scion to build Haskell projects (using Cabal info)
- use Scion to typecheck Haskell source files
- use Scion to typecheck unsaved Haskell source file contents (if no preprocessing is required)
- use Scion to give Haskell source file outline
- built-in Cabal parser
- launch GHCi with options from Cabal file (GHC options, etc)
- automatic GHCi command launch and package reload
