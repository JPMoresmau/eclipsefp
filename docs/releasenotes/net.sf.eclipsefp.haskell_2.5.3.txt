EclipseFP Haskell 2.5.3

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.7.1 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.13 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- pass enable-tests to cabal-dev install-deps so that test dependences are installed too
	- builds are now done inside the build job, which allows better scheduling (running wait for build to complete)
	- cancelling on build and clean actually kills the underlying cabal or buildwrapper process
	- cabal errors show error decorator on project
	- shortcut key and mnemonic for rename action (https://sourceforge.net/p/eclipsefp/discussion/371922/thread/b5fd0a28/?limit=25#725b)
	- hlint uses proper encoding of the file it analyses

Features:
	- warning when launching cabal install on a sandboxed project
	- toggle comment action instead of comment/uncomment (https://sourceforge.net/p/eclipsefp/discussion/371922/thread/7ea2e1eb/#3100)
	- HLint suggestions: a preference can be set to see the suggestion text even if it can be applied automatically (https://sourceforge.net/p/eclipsefp/discussion/371922/thread/79aaff24/#816f)
