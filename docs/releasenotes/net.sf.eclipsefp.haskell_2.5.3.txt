EclipseFP Haskell 2.5.3

Release Notes


Necessary Haskell packages:

	- EclipseFP relies on BuildWrapper, a Haskell IDE library, for a lot of its functionality. See https://github.com/JPMoresmau/BuildWrapper for more information. Version 0.7.1 of buildwrapper has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
	- EclipseFP also uses scion-browser. Version 0.2.13 has been validated with this version of EclipseFP
 

Fixes:
	- pass enable-tests to cabal-dev install-deps so that test dependences are installed too
	- builds are now done inside the build job, which allows better scheduling (running wait for build to complete)
	- cancelling on build and clean actually kills the underlying cabal or buildwrapper process
	- cabal errors show error decorator on project

Features:
	- warning when launching cabal install on a sandboxed project

Internal:


Upgrade notes:
	- Upgrade via the Eclipse install site http://eclipsefp.sf.net/updates.
