This is the changelog file for the experimental EclipseFP 2 development
branch.


Changes in 1.100.0
==================

This is the initial version to kick off the experimental branch.

- Branched off the development branch from the main EclipseFP repo. Since the 
  stable development stream of EclipseFP is heading towards version 1.0, the
  experimental stream is directed roughly towards version 2.0. This means
  that all versioning starts from a floor of 1.100. (This is to allow 1.1.x,
  1.2.x etc. versions as maintenance releases for the stable stream.)
- On this occasion, the EclipseFP feature for Haskell support has been renamed
  from de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell to net.sf.eclipsefp.haskell. It is generally
  not recommended to run an Eclipse installation with both EclipseFP 0.x 
  versions and EclipseFP 1.100.x versions. Please use separate Eclipse 
  installations or uninstall any older versions of EclipseFP.
- I have started regular snapshot builds from this branch.
