Test plan for EclipseFP
=======================

This plan should be worked through for each milestone release and full release,
with every deliverable. It contains a basic checklist for making sure that all
functionality is in the build and is not severely broken. This is only a smoke
test of course (just run and see if it smokes). It must be supplemented by the
automated unit tests and manual feature tests.

- Verify build completeness

  - Run Eclipse and check that the EclipseFP shows up in the About dialog, 
    with the correct version number.
  - Check that the Haskell perspective and root preference page are there.
  - Create a Haskell project, create a source file with a Hello-World, make 
    sure the program can be run and gives its output.

- Haddock support

  - Create a project and open the Haddock wizard; the wizard should be in the 
    FP category, not under 'Other'.
