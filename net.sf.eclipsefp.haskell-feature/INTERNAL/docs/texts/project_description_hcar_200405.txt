May 2004:

Haskell support for the Eclipse IDE

Leif Frenzel (himself@leiffrenzel.de)

The Eclipse platform is an extremly extensible framework for IDEs
(implemented in Java), developed by an Open Source Project. This project
extends it with tools to support Haskell development.

The aim is to develop an IDE for Haskell that provides the set of features
and the user experience known from the Eclipse Java IDE (the flagship of the
Eclipse project), and integrates a broad range of compilers, interpreters,
debuggers, documentation generators and other Haskell development tools.
Long-term goals include a language model with support for intentional
programming, refactoring and structural search.

The project has just started (the initial contribution was in March 2004).
It follows the example and design principles of the Eclipse project. Every
help is very welcome, be it in the form of code contributions (please
contact me), docs or tutorials, or just any feedback if you use the IDE. A
project site at sourceforge.net has just been created.

Status:
There is a working version 0.2 (considered 'alpha') that features a project
model, a configurable source code editor (with syntax coloring and Code
Assist), compiler support for ghc and launching from the IDE.

Haskell support for the Eclipse IDE

Sketch:

Tools support has improved: compiler (GHC), interpreter (Hugs, GHCi), and 
documentation (Haddock) support are included, and the required external tools
can be configured conveniently from the IDE. Work has started on the features
that make the IDE semantics-aware.
