Project description for the Haskell Communities and Activities Report (HCAR)

November 2004:

Haskell support for the Eclipse IDE

Leif Frenzel (himself@leiffrenzel.de)

The Eclipse platform is an extremely extensible framework for IDEs
(implemented in Java), developed by an Open Source Project. This project
extends it with tools to support Haskell development.

The aim is to develop an IDE for Haskell that provides the set of features
and the user experience known from the Eclipse Java IDE (the flagship of the
Eclipse project), and integrates a broad range of compilers, interpreters,
debuggers, documentation generators and other Haskell development tools.
Long-term goals include a language model with support for intentional
programming, refactoring and structural search.

The current version is 0.5 (considered 'alpha'). It features a project
model, a configurable source code editor (with syntax coloring and Code
Assist), compiler support for GHC and launching from the IDE. Since the last
HC&A report we have improved support for GHC options and included facilities
for running HUGS, GHCi and Haddock from the IDE. The goal for the next
months is to make the IDE more language-aware.

Every help is very welcome, be it in the form of code contributions, docs or
tutorials, or just any feedback if you use the IDE. If you want to
participate, please subscribe to the development mailing list (see below).
