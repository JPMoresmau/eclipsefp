May 2005:

Haskell support for the Eclipse IDE

Leif Frenzel (himself@leiffrenzel.de)

The Eclipse platform is an extremely extensible framework for IDEs, developed 
by an Open Source Project. This project extends it with tools to support 
Haskell development.

The aim is to develop an IDE for Haskell that provides the set of features
and the user experience known from the Eclipse Java IDE (the flagship of the
Eclipse project), and integrates a broad range of compilers, interpreters,
debuggers, documentation generators and other Haskell development tools.
Long-term goals include a language model with support for language-aware IDE
features, like refactoring and structural search.

The current version is 0.7 (considered 'alpha'). It features a project
model, a configurable source code editor (with syntax coloring and Code
Assist), compiler support for GHC, interpreter support for GHCi and HUGS, 
documentation generation with Haddock, and launching from the IDE. In the
time between the last HC&A report and now some experimentation with the more 
language-aware features of Eclipse IDEs took place. There is now an 
experimental refactoring support (Rename Module) and a basic implementation of 
a Content Outliner.

Every help is very welcome, be it in the form of code contributions, docs or
tutorials, or just any feedback if you use the IDE. If you want to
participate, please subscribe to the development mailing list (see below).
