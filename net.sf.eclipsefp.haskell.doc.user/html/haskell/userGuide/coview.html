<h2>Compiler Output View</h2>

<p>The <i><b>Compiler Output View</b></i> shows the plain compiler output 
from the last build.</p>

<p>This view is only a temporary measure, usually you should see all important
messages from the compiler in the <i><b>Problems View</b></i>. You will 
(hopefully) need this view only in the rare case when the compiler issues 
a message that could not be applied by the Haskell Tools to the 
<i><b>Problems View</b></i>.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>

<p>There is a preference (<b>Functional Programming &gt; Haskell &gt; 
Compiler</b> to enable or disable displaying the compiler output on this 
view.</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Builds are triggered on every resource change and are directed only 
at changed resources, therefore the information on this view is not 
necessarily helpful for information about the overall project.</p>
