<h1>Generating documentation</h1>

<p>Haddock is a tool for automatically generating documentation from 
annotated Haskell source code. It is not included in the IDE; you have to
download and install Haddock before you can use it from the IDE.</p>

<p><ul>
  <li>You can download Haddock from its website at <a 
  href="https://haskell.org/haddock">https://haskell.org/haddock</a>. You should 
  also download the documentation, which describes how to annotate Haskell
  sources so that Haddock can extract the information that it needs to generate
  the documentation.</li>
  <li>Haddock is usually bundled with the Haskell Platform, so you may already have it installed.
  </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Once you have installed Haddock, you can generate the documentation
in the form of an <b><i>Export</i></b>. Choose from the menu <b>File &gt 
Export</b>, then select <b>Cabal documentation export</b>.</p>

<p>You may also adjust some parameters (like the name of a .css file or
the document title). When everything is set, press <b>Finish</b>. Cabal's and Haddock's
messages (if any) will be displayed in the <b><i>Console View</i></b>.</p>
