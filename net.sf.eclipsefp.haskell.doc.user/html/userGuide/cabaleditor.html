<h2>Cabal Package Description Editor</h2>

<p>Building projects in Eclipse relies on the 
Haskell <a href="http://haskell.org/cabal">Cabal</a>, and to allow you to easily view and modify your project's cabal file,
there is an editor that supports Cabal's package description files.</p>

<p>That editor provides syntax coloring, code folding, a page for the Outline
View, and makes also some templates available that let you easily create
a new Cabal package description.</p>

<p>The editor is by default registered for the file extension 
<code>.cabal</code>. To trigger a template, hit <code>Control+SPACE</code>
at any (non-comment) position in such a file. For some entries (e.g. the 
<code>license-file</code> entry, you can also hold the <code>Control</code>
key and point with the mouse on the value - the entry is then changed into
a link that takes you directly to the referenced file (if it exists) when
you click on it.</p>

<p>Note that saving changes to the Cabal file will trigger a rebuild of the project.</p>
