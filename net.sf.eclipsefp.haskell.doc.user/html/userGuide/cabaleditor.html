<h1>Cabal Package Description Editor</h1>

<p>Building projects in Eclipse relies on the 
Haskell <a href="http://haskell.org/cabal">Cabal</a>, and to allow you to easily view and
modify your project's Cabal file, there is an editor that supports Cabal's package description files.</p>

<p>Note that saving changes to the Cabal file will trigger a rebuild of the project.</p>

<h3>Package</h3>

<p>In the <b>Package</b> you can change the Cabal properties that affect the entire project.
This includes descriptive properties such as project name, version, author, maintainer, license, 
description, homepage; and also properties that affect the build, such as minimal Cabal version.</p>

<h4>Data files</h4>

<p>Some packages need to access data files during its execution. The way Cabal has to deal with them
can be configured in the Cabal editor:
<ul>
<li>Choose the files that will be available,</li>
<li>This will create a new <code>Paths_&lt;package&gt</code> module which tells the paths to
the files in the installed system,</li>
<li>Remember to include this module in the <i>Other</i> section for each component that will 
need access to the data files.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<p>Cabal deals with three kinds of components, that is, objects created from the source code.
Those kinds are libraries, executables and test suites, and can be configured thorugh their
respective tab in the Cabal editor.</p>

<p>In general, there are four configuration sections for each component:
<ul>
<li>
<i>Dependencies</i>: which include information of other packages needed to build the project.<br />
You can add new dependencies clicking the <b>+</b> button. This will open a new window with
the list of packages currently installed in your system.<br />
If you want, you can add a version requirement using the <i>Version</i> column in the table.<br />
</li>
<li><i>Modules</i>: which tell the modules to gather to create the component. Each module can be
in three different states: unselected; with the first column selected, that will expose the module
(when editing a library) or will use it as entry point (when editing an executable or test suite);
or with the second column selected, which will say that the module is a companion module.</li>
<li><i>Source folders</i>: allow you to tell where the project files are located. When creating
a new project, a <code>src</code> folder will be created, and it's recommended to place your
files in that folder.</li>
<li><i>Compiler options</i>: allow you to set flags or enable certain language extensions. Currently,
this section only applies to GHC.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Each project can have at most one library. You can decide whether or not to build one in the
<i>Library</i> tab.
</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <i>Executables</i> and <i>Test suites</i> tabs allow to have as many components
as you want for that type. On the left of the window you will find the list of components that you
already have in your project. You can add more clicking the <b>+</b> button above the list.</p>

<p>For test suites, you can also select the type of test you are creating. Currently ony executable
tests that use Test-framework can be run withing EclipseFP.</p>


<h3>Source</h3>

<p>The source tab provides and editor with syntax coloring, code folding, and makes also some
 templates available that let you easily create a new Cabal package description.</p>

<p>The editor is by default registered for the file extension 
<code>.cabal</code>. To trigger a template, hit <code>Control+SPACE</code>
at any (non-comment) position in such a file. For some entries (e.g. the 
<code>license-file</code> entry, you can also hold the <code>Control</code>
key and point with the mouse on the value - the entry is then changed into
a link that takes you directly to the referenced file (if it exists) when
you click on it.</p>
