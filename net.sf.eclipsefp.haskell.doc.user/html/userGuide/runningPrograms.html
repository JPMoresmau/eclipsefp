<h1>Running</h1>

<p>The EclipseFP plug-in allows you to run your code without going outside of Eclipse.
This speeds ups the coding - debugging cycle and provides some tools for better
inspecting your application. You can read more clicking each tool in the TOC.

<h3>Running applications</h3>

<p>For plainly running an executable, right-click on your project root, go to <b>Run As</b>
and then <b>Haskell Application</b>. You will get a list of the executables defined in
your Cabal file, where you can select the one to run. If only one executable is defined,
it is run by default.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may find the the list of executables hasn't been updated after a 
change in the Cabal file. To get it, clean your project by going to <b>Project &gt; Clean...</b>
in the main menu.</p>

<h3>Running in interpreter</h3>

<p>It is very common in the Haskell world to load a file in the interpreter to directly
test the functions defined on it. You can do the same in EclipseFP right-clicking the module
you want to test and then going to the <b>Run As</b> menu. You can start either a GHCi
session or a Hugs one.</p>
