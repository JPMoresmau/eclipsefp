<h1>SourceGraph</h1>

<p><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SourceGraph">SourceGraph</a> is a tool for
&quot;statically analysing Haskell source code using graph-theoretic techniques&quot;. 
It can provide a helpful insight about the complexity and dependencies of your code, and
make some valuable suggestions on how to improve it.</p>

<p>To generate a SourceGraph report for your project, right click the project root
and select <b>Run SourceGraph</b>. A folder called <code>SourceGraph</code> is generated
inside your project, and the report is automatically shown in Eclipse.</p>
