<h1>Debugging</h1>

<p>This plug-in supports debugging of Haskell modules using GHCi. That means that the features
in this section are available only if the module is run within a GHCi session. To do this,
right-click the module, and select <b>Debug As &gt; GHCi session</b>.</p>

<p>You can add breakpoints in your code double-clicking in the left margin of the source code
editor. A small blue circle will appear in the selected line. You can delete the breakpoint
double-clicking one of those circles. Note that currently EclipseFP does not allow to set
breakpoints in particular expressions, only in entire lines.</p>

<p>Once you start running functions in your module, it is recommended to change to the
<i>Debug</i> perspective by going to the main menu and selecting
<b>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Debug</b>. This gives you access to the debugging tools.</p>

<p>When a breakpoint is reached, the expression being evaluated is shown with a different
background in the code editor. You can step or continue using the buttons available in
the <i>Debug</i> view.</p>

<p>You can also inspect the value of the variables in the <i>Variables</i> view. As withing GHCi,
variables that aren't yet evaluated are shown as <code>_</code>.</p>

<h3>Debugging an executable</h3>

<p>EclipseFP does not support direct debugging of executables. However, you can simulate it
following these steps:
<li>Right-click your main module and select debugging within GHCi,</li>
<li>If you havne't done it yet, add breakpoints to your code,</li>
<li>In the GHCi console, write <code>main</code> and press the Enter key. This will
execute the <code>main</code> function, which is the entry point of your application.</li>
</p>
