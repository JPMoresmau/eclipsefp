<h1>Haskell Editor</h1>

<p>The Haskell source editor provides syntax coloring, Code Assist (context
sensitive code completion), bracket matching and other helpful functionality
to make coding in Haskell more convenient. If HLint is installed in your system,
suggestions for improving your code will be shown too.</p>

<p>The editor supports both the conventional and the literal style of 
source code. Which style is used is determined from the file extension of
the source file (<b>.hs</b> and <b>.lhs</b> for conventional and literate
style resp.).</p>

<p>Code Assist is triggered by pressing <b>CTRL-Space</b> when typing. Code assist is context sensitive and can show you:<ul>
<li>Functions, types and constructors in normal code</li>
<li>Types in type signatures</li>
<li>Modules in import statement</li>
<li>Pragma in LANGUAGE directives</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The Outline View shows the overall structure of the Haskell source file
in the currently active editor.</p>

<p>Certain regions of the editor can be folded into one line and unfolded
with the small '-' and '+' buttons in the left editor ruler.</p>

<p>The Haskell worksheet views allows you to enter expressions evaluated when your file is changed. 
This is like GHCi except your expressions are preserved over save/reload of your file. The recalculation is done automatically.
Several output formats like simple text or HTML are supported.
</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Many of the features of the generic text editor can be configured in the
Preferences at <b>General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors</b>. Some Haskell specific settings can be found under <b>Haskell &gt; Editor</b></p>

<h3>Key shortcuts</h3>

<p>Beside the standard text editing functionality (like Copy/Cut/Paste, 
Undo and Redo etc.) there are the following Haskell-specific shortcuts:</p>

<p><table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;C</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Toggle comment (add or remove <b>--</b> to the start of the selected lines)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;P</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Add pragram comment ({-# ... #-} )</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td><b>Shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;D&nbsp;F</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Add an Haddock comment before the current element (the element Follows the documention)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;D&nbsp;P</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Add an Haddock comment after the current element</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;D&nbsp;B</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Add an Haddock block comment before the current element (the element Follows the documention)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Shift&nbsp;+&nbsp;Alt&nbsp;+&nbsp;R</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Rename the current element (if your project builds successfully, all instances of the element should be renamed everywhere they're used)</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>
