<h1>Haskell Editor</h1>

<p>The Haskell source editor provides syntax coloring, Code Assist (context
sensitive code completion), bracket matching and other helpful functionality
to make coding in Haskell more convenient. If HLint is installed in your system,
suggestions for improving your code will be shown too.</p>

<p>The editor supports both the conventional and the literal style of 
source code. Which style is used is determined from the file extension of
the source file (<b>.hs</b> and <b>.lhs</b> for conventional and literate
style resp.).</p>

<p>Code Assist is triggered by pressing <b>CTRL-Space</b> when typing.</p>

<p>The Outline View shows the overall structure of the Haskell source file
in the currently active editor.</p>

<p>Certain regions of the editor can be folded into one line and unfolded
with the small '-' and '+' buttons in the left editor ruler.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Many of the features of the generic text editor can be configured in the
Preferences at <b>General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors</b>. Some Haskell specific settings can be found under <b>Haskell &gt; Editor</b></p>

<h3>Key shortcuts</h3>

<p>Beside the standard text editing functionality (like Copy/Cut/Paste, 
Undo and Redo etc.) there are the following Haskell-specific shortcuts:</p>

<p><table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" width="100%" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;/<br>Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;7</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Comment (add <b>--</b> to the start of the current line)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;+Shift&nbsp;/<br>Ctrl&nbsp;+&nbsp;&szlig;</b></td>
    <td valign="top">Uncomment (remove <b>--</b> from the start of the current line)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Home</b></td>
    <td>Go to the first non-whitespace character of the current line</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>
