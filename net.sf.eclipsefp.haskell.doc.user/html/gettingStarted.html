<h2>A quick start guide to Haskell programming with Eclipse</h2>

<p>This document shows how you would create and run the 'Hello World'
application in Eclipse with Haskell support. It also explains some of the
main user interface elements in Eclipse. The focus is on helping
developers who are not familiar with Eclipse to quickly get started 
with it as an IDE that supports Haskell development.</p>

<p>
  <ul><li>
  More information about how to use Eclipse can be found in the 
  <b>Workbench User Guide</b> which is included in the Eclipse
  Help.
  </li><li>
  For more information about Haskell go to <a href="http://haskell.org">
  http://haskell.org</a>.
  </li><li>
  Note that you need an installation of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC)
  on your system. (See 
  <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc">http://haskell.org/ghc</a>.) If you don't,
  you can still work with Haskell sources (and run them in HUGS), but you
  won't see any syntax errors etc., and there will be no executable 
  automatically built from the sources.
  </li></ul>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is work in progress, which means that some of the features
described here may not yet be in place.</p>

<h3><a name="preparations">Preparations</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Open the Haskell Perspective</b>
    <p>
      Eclipse makes use of a concept called <b><i>Perspectives</i></b>.
      Everything in the workspace is seen from such a Perspective. When you 
      start Eclipse for the first time, the most basic of all Perspectives is 
      open: the <i>Resource Perspective</i>, which handles just some basic 
      file management and text editing. By openening the Haskell perspective, 
      you activate everything that is Haskell-aware.
    </p>
    <ul><li><p>
      Select from the menu: <b>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Haskell</b>. 
      (You can also open the Haskell Perspective from a link on the 
      <b>Welcome</b> page.)
    </p></li></ul>
    <p>
      Seen from the Haskell Perspective, a file is not just a file, but (if it 
      has the correct extension) a Haskell source file, which means that you 
      can open it with the Haskell source editor, you can compile it and run 
      it with a Haskell interpreter (like HUGS) or as (e.g. with GHC) 
      compiled and linked executable. The Perspective  contains also some 
      <b><i>Views</i></b>, which provide Haskell-specific information about 
      the file which is currently opened in the editor (<b>Outline View</b>) 
      or about the last build process (in the <b>Console View</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can switch and close Perspectives at any time from the vertical 
      toolbar at the left of the workbench. If you have closed a Perspective 
      or a View, you can re-open it from the menu <b>Window &gt; Open 
      Perspective</b> or <b>Show View</b>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b><a name="haskellProject">Create a new Haskell project</a></b></p>
    <p>
      The workspace is organized into <i><b>Projects</b></i> (roughly:
      directories within the workspace directory).
    </p>
  
    <ul><li><p>
      Create a new project by selecting <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project</b> from 
      the menu, expanding the <b>Functional programming</b> icon, then choosing 
      <b>Haskell Project</b>. Specify a project name and hit <b>OK</b>.
    </p></li></ul>
  
    <p>
      A Haskell project has some properties:
      <ul>
	    <li><b>source folder</b> (where the compiler expects the sources)</li>
		<li><b>output folder</b> (used by the compiler for object files)</li>
		<li><b>binaries folder</b> (where the target executable is put)</li>
		<li><b>target binary name</b> (the name of the executable produced 
		by the compiler and linker).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the project has been created, you will see the respective folders, 
      which are created by the <b>New Project</b> wizard. You can configure 
      these settings on the <b>Preference Page</b> for that wizard.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="createSource">Create and edit source files</a></h3>

  <p>
    Add source files to the project source folder.
  </p>

  <ul><li><p>
    Files can be created either from the menu (<b>File &gt; New</b>), or from 
    the context menu you get when you right-click the project in the 
    <i>Project Explorer</i> View).
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    For the 'Hello world' program, create a new file named 
    <code>Main.hs</code>.
  </p></li></ul>

  <p>
    If you give the files a Haskell-specific extension (like <code>.hs</code>
    or <code>.lhs</code> (for literate Haskell), you can open the files with
    the <i><b>Haskell source code editor</b></i> from the Project Explorer 
    view.</p>
  </p>

  <ul><li><p>
    Right-click the file and choose <b>Open with &gt;Haskell editor</b>. 
    Type some code.
  </p></li></ul>

  <p>You can configure the editor in the main <i><b>Preferences Dialog</b></i>:
  Select <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b> from the menu and choose the 
  <b>Functional Programming</b> section.</p>

<ul>  
  <li><p>
  Enter the code for your 'Hello world', e.g.
  <table width="50%"><tr><td bgcolor="#d0d0d0"><pre><code>
  <b>module</b> Main <b>where</b>
  
  main = putStr "Hello world!"
  <code></pre><td><tr></table>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <b>Save</b>. This will trigger the auto building, and you will see compiler 
    errors (if there were errors in the build) in the <b><i>Problems 
    View</i></b>. If no errors have occured, the compiled object files and 
    the linked executable should be in their respective folders. Auto building
    works incrementally, that is, only changed resources are built when you 
    save again.
  </p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="run">Run the application</a></h3>

  <p>
    You can launch the compiled executable of your Haskell programs from within
    the IDE.
  </p>

  <ul><li>
    Select <b>Run As &gt; Haskell Application</b> from the menu <b>Run</b> (or
    from the lauching icon that looks like a white triangle in a green circle).
    You can also right-click the executable in the Project Explorer view
    and choose <b>Run &gt; Haskell Application</b> from the popup menu.
  </li></ul>
  
  <p>
    Running a program creates a new <b>Launch configuration</b> for that
    program. You can re-run a lauch configuration from the <b>Run</b> menu.
    Clicking the Run-icon re-launches always the last launched configuration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you choose <b>Run ...</b> from the menu, you get a dialog where you 
    can edit launch configurations. For example, you may want to add parameters
    to the program launch.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Console input and output are handled by the <b>Console View</b> (at the 
    bottom left of the workbench). You should see the 'Hello world' output 
    appear there, and if your program takes console input, the Console View 
    is where you can type in while developing.
  </p>
