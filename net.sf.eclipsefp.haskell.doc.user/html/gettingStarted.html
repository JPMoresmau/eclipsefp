<h2>A quick start guide to Haskell programming with Eclipse</h2>

<p>This document shows how you would create and run the 'Hello World'
application in Eclipse with Haskell support. It also explains some of the
main user interface elements in Eclipse. The focus is on helping
developers who are not familiar with Eclipse to quickly get started 
with it as an IDE that supports Haskell development.</p>

<p>
  <ul><li>
  More information about how to use Eclipse can be found in the 
  <b>Workbench User Guide</b> which is included in the Eclipse
  Help.
  </li><li>
  For more information about Haskell go to <a href="http://haskell.org">
  http://haskell.org</a>.
  </li></ul>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This is work in progress, which means that some of the features
described here may not yet be in place.</p>

<h3><a name="preparations">Preparations</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Open the Haskell Perspective</b>
    <p>
      Eclipse makes use of a concept called <b><i>Perspectives</i></b>.
      Everything in the workspace is seen from such a Perspective. When you 
      start Eclipse for the first time, the most basic of all Perspectives is 
      open: the <i>Resource Perspective</i>, which handles just some basic 
      file management and text editing. By openening the Haskell perspective, 
      you activate everything that is Haskell-aware.
    </p>
    <ul><li><p>
      Select from the menu: <b>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Haskell</b>. 
      (You can also open the Haskell Perspective from a link on the 
      <b>Welcome</b> page.)
    </p></li></ul>
    <p>
      Seen from the Haskell Perspective, a file is not just a file, but (if it 
      has the correct extension) a Haskell source file, which means that you 
      can open it with the Haskell source editor, you can compile it and run 
      it with a Haskell interpreter (like HUGS) or as (e.g. with GHC) 
      compiled and linked executable. The Perspective  contains also some 
      <b><i>Views</i></b>, which provide Haskell-specific information about 
      the file which is currently opened in the editor (<b>Outline View</b>) 
      or about the last build process (in the <b>Console View</b>).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can switch and close Perspectives at any time from the vertical 
      toolbar at the left of the workbench. If you have closed a Perspective 
      or a View, you can re-open it from the menu <b>Window &gt; Open 
      Perspective</b> or <b>Show View</b>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b><a name="haskellProject">Create a new Haskell project</a></b></p>
    <p>
      The workspace is organized into <i><b>Projects</b></i> (roughly:
      directories within the workspace directory).
    </p>
  
    <ul><li><p>
      Create a new project by selecting <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project</b> from 
      the menu, expanding the <b>Haskell</b> icon, then choosing 
      <b>Haskell Project</b>. Specify a project name and hit <b>OK</b>.
    </p></li>
 	<li><p>Specify a project name</p></li>
 	<li><p>Specify where you want the project to reside (default is inside your workspace</p></li>
 	<li><p>Specify some initial components to be created for you. The New Project wizard will auto generate a cabal file that will contain a reference to each component you select. You can choose to create an executable, a library, or both.</p></li>
   	</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="createSource">Create and edit source files</a></h3>

  <p>
    Add source files to the project source folder.
  </p>

	<p>If you have selected "executable" in the new project wizard page, a 
    <code>Main.hs</code> file should have been created for you. 
    Otherwise you can create a new Haskell module from the menu (<b>File &gt; New &gt; Haskell &gt; Haskell Module</b>).
    The second page of the wizard lets you choose in which component the module will be present. You can have a project with several components, and not all modules are present in all components.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you give the files a Haskell-specific extension (like <code>.hs</code>
    or <code>.lhs</code> (for literate Haskell), you can open the files with
    the <i><b>Haskell source code editor</b></i> from the Project Explorer 
    view.</p>
  </p>

  <ul><li><p>
    Right-click the file and choose <b>Open with &gt;Haskell editor</b>. 
    Type some code.
  </p></li></ul>

  <p>You can configure the editor in the main <i><b>Preferences Dialog</b></i>:
  Select <b>Window &gt; Preferences</b> from the menu and choose the 
  <b>General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors</b> section.</p>

<ul>  
  <li><p>
  Enter the code for your 'Hello world', e.g.
  <table width="50%"><tr><td bgcolor="#d0d0d0"><pre><code>
  <b>module</b> Main <b>where</b>
  
  main = putStr "Hello world!"
  <code></pre><td><tr></table>
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    <b>Save</b>. This will trigger the auto building, and you will see compiler 
    errors (if there were errors in the build) in the <b><i>Problems 
    View</i></b>. If no errors have occurred, the compiled object files and 
    the linked executable should be in their respective folders. Auto building
    works incrementally, that is, only changed resources are built when you 
    save again.
  </p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="run">Run the application</a></h3>

  <p>
    You can launch the compiled executable of your Haskell programs from within
    the IDE.
  </p>

  <ul><li>
    Select <b>Run As &gt; Haskell Application</b> from the contexual <b>Run</b> menu on the project. 
    This is only available if your project contains executable modules and if it has been built by Scion.
  </li></ul>
  
  <p>
    Running a program creates a new <b>Launch configuration</b> for that
    program. You can re-run a lauch configuration from the <b>Run</b> menu.
    Clicking the Run-icon re-launches always the last launched configuration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you choose <b>Run ...</b> from the menu, you get a dialog where you 
    can edit launch configurations. For example, you may want to add parameters
    to the program launch.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Console input and output are handled by the <b>Console View</b> (at the 
    bottom left of the workbench). You should see the 'Hello world' output 
    appear there, and if your program takes console input, the Console View 
    is where you can type in while developing.
  </p>

 <h3><a name="run">Run a module in the interpreter</a></h3>
 
 <p>You can right click on any Haskell module and choose <b>Run GHCi session</b>. This will open GHCi, the GHC interpreter, in a Eclipse console, and load all the required modules.</p>
 
 <p>You can type in that console and have a full interactive session, modifying your modules in the Eclipse editors and running code in the console</p>
 
 <p>The launch configuration options for interpreter sessions let you configure some automation features, like automatically reloading modules that you've saved in the editor.</p>
