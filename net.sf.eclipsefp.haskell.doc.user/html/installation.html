<h1>Installation steps</h1>
<p>If you see this, you have successfully installed the eclipseFP plugins. 
However there may still be some configuration steps to be done before you can use the plugins fully.</p>

<h3>GHC configuration</h3>
<p>
EclipseFP requires GHC to compile Haskell source files. 
We recommend installing the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a> that comes with all required libraries bundled in a installer for your platform.
You can configure GHC by opening the Eclipse Preferences and going to <b>Haskell &gt; Haskell implementations</b>. If a GHC is in your PATH you should see it in the list. Otherwise you can manually add a GHC installation.
</p>

<h3>Cabal configuration</h3>
<p>
EclipseFP also requires a working Cabal. <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal">Cabal</a> is a build management tool for Haskell. Similarly, the Haskell Platform contains a version of Cabal compatible with the GHC it ships with.
You can configure Cabal in the Eclipse Preferences under <b>Haskell &gt; Scion, Browser and Cabal</b>. By default EclipseFP will have looked in your PATH and use any Cabal installation it can find there.
</p>

<h3>Scion and Browser configuration</h3>
<p>
Scion is a Haskell program that uses GHC and Cabal to give a consistent API to manage and build Haskell projects. EclipseFP uses Scion for a lot of operations.
Scion-Browser is another small component that serves information about the installed packages in your system.
Both come in source form, and they should get built automatically once GHC and Cabal have been set up.
The Eclipse Preferences page under <b>Haskell &gt; Scion, Browser and Cabal</b> allows you to change settings if required. 
We recommend to stick to default setting (built-in server through Standard Stream/Pipe) unless you feel adventurous! 
</p>

<h4>Problems building Scion and Browser</h4>
<p>
It may happen that Scion or Browser do not build successfully when you start EclipseFP. 
The build process dumps its outputs and errors into a Console in the Console View of Eclipse. Please check this file for errors.
Often, the build fails due to some libraries conflict. Please run <code>cabal update</code> before restarting EclipseFP. 
This will ensure your Cabal knows about the latest versions of libraries available on Hackage.
</p>

<h3>Extra programs</h3>
<p>
You will get extra functionality if you install several Haskell programs. To be more concrete:
<ul>
<li>If you install <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/">Hoogle</a>, you will be able to search functions or types in your installed packages. To get it, run <code>cabal install hoogle</code>
in a console. The next time EclipseFP starts, it will detect and configure it for use.</li>
<li>If you install <a href="http://community.haskell.org/~ndm/hlint/">HLint</a>, suggestions for improving your code will appear in the Haskell editor. Install it running 
<code>cabal install hlint</code>.</li>
<li>EclipseFP can run unit tests created with <a href="http://batterseapower.github.com/test-framework/">Test-framework</a>. You can install it running
<code>cabal install test-framework test-framework-quickcheck2 test-framework-hunit</code> (to be able to use QuickCheck and HUnit tests).</li>
<li>You can produce information about your modules using <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/SourceGraph">SourceGraph</a>. Get it executing <code>cabal install SourceGraph</code>.</li>
</ul>
