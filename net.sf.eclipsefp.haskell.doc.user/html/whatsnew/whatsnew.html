<h2>What's new</h2>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This version of EclipseFP is from a development branch that works towards
a version 2.0, involving a re-work of almost every part of the software.
With each milestone build, this changelog lists the changes to the previous
milestone version. (The long numbers in square brackets are SourceForge 
ticket IDs.)</p>

<h4>Changes from version 1.102 to version 1.103 (M3)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>[ 1922446 ] introduced a new form-based editor for Cabal files. The 
  editor has a form-based UI for entering and viewing information, and a 
  second tab with the old text-based Cabal file editor.</li>
  <li>introduced a wizard for importing cabalized packages. The wizard lets
  the user select a .tar.gz archive from the file system and creates a new
  Haskell project in the workspace with the contents of the archive.</li>
  <li>[ 1922458 ] multiple project executables</li>
  <li>[ 1922451 ] generate .cabal file for new Haskell project in 
  workspace</li>
  <li>Fix: [ 1922898 ] [Editor] unstable markers</li>
  <li>Fix: [ 1838106 ] [Editor] Wrong coloring of comments in string 
  literals</li>
  <li>Fix: [ 1837352 ] [Editor] Highlighting quotations inside apostrophies</li>
  <li>phased out the Module Browser view</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes from version 1.101 to version 1.102 (M2)</h4>

<ul>
  <li>GHC installation is now configured on a 'Haskell installations'
  preference page, replaced and compacted several old preference pages-</li>
  <li>replaced the Navigator and Module Browser views by the Project Explorer
  in the Haskell perspective</li>
  <li>extended ghci launch shortcut so that we can launch a file from the 
  editor</li>
  <li>Cabal file validation in Haskell projects</li>
  <li>phased out the configurator wizard</li>
  <li>[ 1885803 ] [Launch] add source folders automatically to ghci path</li>
  <li>extended project model to allow multiple Haskell source paths in Haskell 
  projects</li>
  <li>changes to the plugin map: inlined common.* and cabal.* plugins,
  platform-specific code into fragments</li>
  <li>fixed several syntax coloring issues and robustness problems</li>
</ul>

<h4>Changes from version 1.100 to version 1.101 (M1)</h4>

<p>This is the initial version to kick off the experimental branch.</p>

<ul>
  <li>[1808245] pointfree refactoring. Select a code portion and then choose
  <b>Refactor > Pointfree-style notation</b> from the context menu.</li>
  <li>[1809041] mark occurrences. Occurrences of the identifier which is
  currently under the cursor position are highlighted in the code.</li>
  <li>[1809822] and [1809053] introduced "Source" and "Refactor" submenus in 
  the context menu of the Haskell code editor</li>
  <li>[1807988] added category for Haddock export wizard</li>
  <li>[1807983] renamed EclipseFP feature to net.sf.eclipsefp.haskell<br>
  This means that the feature id has changed. If you have one or more
  old versions of EclipseFP installed (i.e. one of the 0.x versions), you
  should uninstall them before installing one of the 1.10x.x versions.</li>
  <li>[1807990] renamed docs and branding plugins to net.sf.eclipsefp.*</li>
  <li>[1809048] and [1809049] removed references to JFace plugins in core
  plugins</li>
</ul>

<h4>Version 1.100</h4>

<p>This build contained no changes at all, it is just the branching point
from the 1.0 development stream.</p>


<h3>Old changelog</h3>

<p>This is the old changelog portion from the 1.0 stream:</p>

<p>2005-08-14 Some fixes, built against Eclipse 3.1 (final)</p>

<p>Note: the sources are no longer included in the download. There is a Darcs 
repository with all necessary sources for those who are interested in them.
The URL of the repository is <code>http://eclipsefp.sf.net/repo/</code>. See
<a href="http://darcs.net">http://darcs.net</a> for more information about 
Darcs.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Core</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a nasty problem with the parser which caused the workbench 
        to crash. Thanks to Alistair Bailey for reporting the problem.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed an exception that occured when launching a project that has 
        no executable (gives a more 'speaking' message now). Thanks to Andrew 
        Frank for reporting this bug.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.8.0</h4>

<p>2005-05-16 Eclipse 3.1M7 compatibility, more language model work</p>

<p>Note: the ltk has now moved to the Platform feature, which means that
you don't need the JDK feature anymore; the Haskell plugins will run on
the Platform.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Core</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Completed the language model (imports, exports, declarations), 
        both with respect to modeling and parsing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>The complete language model is displayed in the Outline View.</li>
        <li>Added code folding to the Haskell editor (top-level declarations
        that span multiple lines can be folded).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.7.0</h4>

<p>2005-05-12 Eclipse 3.1M6 compatibility, native parser integration, 
              prototypical refactoring support</p>

<p>Note: Eclipse 3.1 M6 is now required! If you need an Eclipse 3.0.x or 3.1
M1-M5a for some reason, it is probably better to keep using the former 
version, 0.6. And you need the Eclipse SDK (or at least the Platform Runtime
<i>plus</i> the JDT Runtime). The Platform runtime is not sufficient, because
the language toolkit, which I use for the Refactoring support, is still part
of JDT. (I think this will change soon, so this in only temporarily.)</p>

<p>Note: Although the code is still platform-independent, there are now
different binaries for different platforms. I have only built a version for
win32. It will run on other platforms, but the native parser support is missing 
there.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Core</b>
      <ul>
        <li>There is now an integration for a <i><b>native parser</b></i>, 
        accessed via JNI. (The parser is from the <code>language-src</code> 
        package.) This means there are now platform-specific fragments with 
        the native libraries.</li>
        <li>Started to extend the language model interfaces. The model is
        quite aligned with that in <code>Language.Haskell.Syntax</code>. It
        is filled using the native parser.</li>
        <li>Fix: error in property tester killed run context menu</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Started to fill the <i><b>Outline View</b></i> with information 
        from the language model.</li>
        <li><p>A first prototypical <i><b>refactoring</b></i>: Rename Module 
        (changes the module name in the module declaration and in import 
        statements in other files, and renames the source file of the 
        module).</p>
        <p><i>Please keep in mind</i> that this is still experimental and that 
        not every possible problem case is checked for (or even known to 
        me ;-).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.6.0</h4>

<p>2004-11-23 Configurator wizard, improved stability and usability</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Core</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Several small fixes to improve stability (exceptions with closed 
        projects in the log, problems with source folder determination ...)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>There is now a wizard called configurator that can be used to
        configure external commands like compilers etc. used in the IDE. 
        (Available from the main toolbar, the one with the 'FP' icon.) The
        idea is to make it possible for the user to conveniently set up the
        external stuff from one single dialog. I have also added some 
        rudimentary probing for the needed commands (but it needs some 
        optimization still). The architecture is extensible and resides in 
        the common plugins, so it can be used from all over eclipsefp. I 
        implemented it for GHC, HUGS and Haddock.</li>
        <li>Editor: Markers in the vertical ruler on the left show now the 
        message as tooltip.</li>
        <li>Launches: The interactive launches have now the project directory
        as working directory. (This is only the most simple thing to be done
        with the interactive console support, more will follow - thanks to Rod 
        Price for alerting me about this)</li>
        <li>Fix: NPE when creating a new launch configuration in the dialog</li>
        <li>Fix: problems with UI component disposal on the import libraries
        property page</li>
        <li>Fix: wrap file names in quotes for HUGS launch (in case there are
        spaces in the path) - thanks to Michael Osipov for the report</li>
        <li>Fix: project executable did not show up in the Module Browser
        when the project itself was the source folder</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Documentation</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Added shortcut list to editor docs</li>
        <li>Added a cheatsheet for getting started with the Haskell 
        environment</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.5.0</h4>

<p>2004-11-04 Haddock and HUGS support, and improved GHC options support 
              and editor.</p>

<p>The license has been changed from CPL 1.0 to EPL 1.0.</p>

<p>All plugins have been updated to the new Eclipse 3 runtime model. 
Development is now done on the latest Eclipse 3.1 Milestones (but it should 
work fine with Eclipse 3.0.x). The common.* plugins have been renamed. (You may 
have to remove plugins from older versions, if problems occur.)</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You can now start HUGS sessions from the Run menu.</li>
        <li>There is a new Export wizard for Haddock documentation, which can 
        be used to run Haddock over a set of files from a Haskell project.</li>
        <li>There is a field to specify extra GHC options on the GHC Preference 
        Page.</li>
        <li>The editor has now shortcuts for commenting / uncommenting
        lines of code and navigating to the first (non-whitespace) character
        of the line (thanks to Andriy Palamarchuk :-)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Documentation</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Added documentation for the Haddock Export wizard.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.4.0</h4>

<p>2004-07-19 Interpreter support (GCHi) and more bugfixes.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Core</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Before building it is now checked that the output and binary 
        folders for the Haskell project exist (they may not, for instance 
        if the project was just checked out from a code repository).</li>
        <li>Fixed two bugs in creating the command line and the external
        process for the compiler 
        (ghc-6.2.1: can't apply -o to multiple source files). 
        <br>Thanks to Andrei for the fix :-)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>You can now start an interactive GHCi session from the Run menu, 
        with either a single source file or all source files in a project or 
        source folder loaded. This is especially useful when you don't want 
        to build an entire application but are working in a more scripting-like 
        manner.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.3.0</h4>

<p>2004-06-12 Mainly bugfixes and improved ghc compiler support.</p>

<p>Note: Eclipse 3.0 M9/RC1/RC2 is now required!</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Core</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Made the extensions of Haskell source files (.hs, .lhs) known to 
          the Team plugins as text-type files.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Bugfix: Module browser crashed when project with no path settings 
        was created.</li>
        <li>Added preference page for ghc compiler options.</li>
        <li>Added a 'New Haskell Module' wizard with some support for qualified
          modules.
        </li>
        <li>Put an action bar contributor in the Editor, so that some standard
          actions (encoding etc.) in the menu and some standard informations
          (insert mode, current cursor position ...) in the status bar are 
          available.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Documentation</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Added compiler settings documentation.</li>
        <li>Updated overview page with the changed project page etc.</li>        
        <li>fixed TOC structure in the Help</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.2.0</h4>

<p>2004-04-28 Started to make the user interface more convenient.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Core</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Bugfix: ghc build not triggered when the ghc executable was not on 
          the PATH.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>UI</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Import libraries are now properties of projects (they are no longer 
          set globally in the preferences). They can be found by right-clicking 
          a Haskell project in the workspace and then selecting 
          <b>Properties > Import Libraries</b>.
        </li>
        <li>
          New View: Module Browser (for browsing workspace projects in a more
          Haskell-aware way).
        </li>
        <li>
          Made the Haskell editor more configurable (syntax colors etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Documentation</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Continued to add some basic user documentation (included texts 
        for UI elements like views, editor).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>de.leiffrenzel.fp.haskell_0.1.0</h4>

<p>2004-03-10 This is the initial version.</p>
