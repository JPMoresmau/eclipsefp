<h2>Module Browser</h2>

<p>The <b><i>Module Browser</i></b> is the Haskell-aware equivalent of the
<b><i>Resource Navigator</i></b>. It presents all elements of a Haskell 
project, but in a more language-specific way. This includes not only 
compilation units (Haskell source files), but also import libraries, 
the project executable etc.</p>

<p>The <i><b>Module Browser</b></i> can be configured to filter out any type 
of language elements. The filter settings can be found in the dropdown view 
menu directly on the view.</p>

<p><i>(In the future this View will allow browsing through more fine-grained
elements and not stop on the level of compilation units.)</i></p>
