<h2>Compilers and Interpreters</h2>

<p>Please note that this IDE does not come with any Haskell language 
implementations (compilers or interpreters). You need one of the supported 
implementations installed on your system. Depending on your setup, the 
executable of the compiler or interpreter can be on the PATH or not. If it is 
not, you need also to specify its path from the preferences
(<b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Functional Programming &gt; Compiler</b>, 
then select the preference page of that particular compiler, e.g. 
<b>GHC Settings</b>).</p>

<p><i><b>Compilers</b></i> are used by the plugin to build Haskell projects 
(on changes of the source files in that project). Usually you won't have to
trigger compilation by hand. Options for compilers can be set on their 
preference pages.</p>

<p>Running sessions in an <i><b>interpreter</b></i> works like running 
compiled applications: select one or more source file(s) and choose 
<b>Run &gt; Run As</b> from the menu, then select the interpreter you want to 
use.</p>

<!--
<h4>Project specific compiler settings</h4>

<p>Compiler settings in the preferences apply to every Haskell project in the
workspace. If you want specific settings for a project, you can override the
global settings for that project. Open the properties of the project (right-
click the project and select <b>Properties</b>), and then choose 
<b>Compiler</b>. Here you can change the compiler settings for the selected 
project only.</p>
