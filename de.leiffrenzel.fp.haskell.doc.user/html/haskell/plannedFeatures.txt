Planned features (2005-05-16)

- Basics: - Haskell projects, and a wizard for creating a new one
          - Haskell projects have source, output and binary folders, and an
            executable name for the project can be specified
          - import libraries for the compiler can be selected freely from the
            file system for every Haskell project

- Compiler support: - general compiler infrastructure that can be extended to 
                      support different Haskell compilers on various platforms
                    - Compiler Output View: logs the compiler output of the 
                      last build (hopefully this will no longer be needed once
                      compiler output parsing gets more mature)
                    - Problems viewer support (if a compiler output parser for 
                      the compiler is available)

                    - GHC support included
                    - GHC output parser included
                    - GHC preference pages for options

                    - PLANNED: similar support for other compilers (NHC)

- Launching: - (compiled) target executable can be launched from a launch 
               shortcut
             - launch a project or file with an interpreter
               - GHCi
               - HUGS
               
- Debugging  - PLANNED

- Editor: configurable source code editor for Haskell source files 
          (including 'literate' Haskell)
          - Content Outline viewer: displays the structure of the 
            currently edited file in hierarchical form
          - Syntax coloring (rule-based)
          - Code Assist: proposals for keywords and Prelude functions
          - PLANNED: syntax coloring (syntax-based)
          - PLANNED: source formatting (indentation)
          - PLANNED: Code Assist: context-sensitive completion of keywords
                     and functions
          - PLANNED: structural search
          - PLANNED: source navigation
                     
- UI: Module Browser, a view for browsing the contents of a Haskell project
      - language-specific view, displays compilation units, import libraries,
        project executable
      - support for filters
      - PLANNED working set support
      - PLANNED DnD for source files
      
- Wizards: - New Haskell Project
           - New Module
           - Export generated documentation (Haddock integration)
           - Export/Import project as Cabal package
           
- Refactoring: - PLANNED HaRe integration
               - Refactoring support using the Eclipse language toolkit (ltk):
                 - Rename Module
