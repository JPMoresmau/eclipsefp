     Builder script for the GHC Compiler sub-plugin.
     
     This script controls the build process for the parser, that starts
     with the translation from the parser-definition language to Java.
     
     Tools needed:
     
     - ANTLR: The script was originally designed for version 2.7.5,
     using later versions should be no big deal.
     
 	 ANTLR is available at http://www.antlr.org
 	 
 	 If you've got the full eclipsefp project, there should be a
 	 org.antlr side-by-side with this one. It includes the
 	 antlr.jar for version 2.7.6, and this script is designed to use that
 	 Jar. If this is your case, you probably just need to run the script.
 	 
 	 If you don't wish to obtain that, or if you wish to use a newer
 	 ANTLR version, you can set your CLASSPATH variable to point to
 	 another library. This will take precendence over the included Jar.
 	 
 	 - Java Software Development Kit (JDK): you should already have this
 	 in order to run any Ant build. This script was designed and
 	 tested with JDK1.5 (or JDK5.0, if you'd like), but any version
 	 from 1.3 should work
