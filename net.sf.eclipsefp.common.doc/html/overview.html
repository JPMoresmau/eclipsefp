<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  This is the overview page for the functional programming tools features,
  implemented by an open source project located at 
  <a href="http://eclipsefp.sourceforge.net">eclipsefp.sourceforge.net</a>.
</p>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>
  <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> is an open source project that 
  has at its center an extensible, universal plugin architecture and a 
  (meanwhile very popular) IDE. There are various programming languages 
  already supported by this IDE, namely Java, C/C++, COBOL and more.
</p>

<p>We are adding development tools for functional programming to that 
  framework. These tools extend the Eclipse IDE to support currently 
  <a href="http://haskell.org">Haskell</a>, a pure, non-strict functional 
  programming language, and <a href="http://www.ocaml.org">Objective Caml</a>.
