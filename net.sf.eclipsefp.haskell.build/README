EclipseFP Automatic Build

Author: Thiago Arrais - thiago.arrais@gmail.com

These files are used when automatic building EclipseFP. In order to 
start the build process, you will need the following:

- A suitable Java VM for running Eclipse
- Eclipse 3.1.1 with JDT and PDE (if you didn't download a platform-only 
archive, you probably already have it)
- A Darcs executable binary on the default path, for fetching the 
sources

Although Eclipse is needed, it will be started by the build scripts in 
headless mode. The process can be completely run from a shell prompt.

The build can be customized with the following environment variables. 
The only required variable is ECLIPSEFP_HOME, the others have default 
values.

ECLIPSEFP_HOME: The directory that holds the sources for the plugin 
projects

ECLIPSE_HOME: The directory that holds the Eclipse application to be 
used for building. Most releases from 3.1.1 and on will do, although
the shell script will need to be updated when using later releases (see 
below). Defaults to '/opt/eclipse/platform/3.1.1/eclipse'

ECLIPSEFP_BUILD_TARGET_DIR: Where the build process will be executed. 
Defaults to 'ECLIPSEFP_HOME/tmp/build'

ECLIPSEFP_JAVA_INTERPRETER: The command used to start the Java VM used 
during the build. Defaults do 'java'.

If a non-3.1.1 Eclipse is used, the variable pdeBuildPluginVersion 
inside the build shell script must be updated. This variable holds the 
version id for the org.eclipse.pde.build plugin. Refer to your 
Eclipse installation for the correct string.
